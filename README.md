EVIL S was here

marking period 3 project, remake of my [marking period 1 project](https://github.com/you277/java)

some strange choices like copy pasting an equals method and toString method into every class is due to project requirements

game concept, design, and sprite all by me (ceat_ceat, aka you277).
title screen music from flood escape 2 by crazyblox.
game music from super hexagon
